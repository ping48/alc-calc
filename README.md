Treehacks 2020 Project: Helping mantain safe drinking habits!

Alcohol, while it can be fun at times, can also be a real problem! As college students, our team has seen the effects unsafe drinking everywhere on our respective campuses. Our schools did a great job informing us on how to drink safely, and most students know pacing the amount of drinks is a important for safety. This is reflected in the common habit of marking tallies on their arms, but that gives no consideration for the time at which the drinks were consumed. Keeping track of all these drinks and their time stamps are difficult to do in your head, so we made an app do it for us!
